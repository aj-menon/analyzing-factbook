In this project, we will be working with the data from the [Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/). The database, `factbook.db` used in this analysis can be downloaded [here](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/257/factbook.db) .
